# 🚒 Arduino Fire-Fighting Robot

This repository contains the Arduino code for an autonomous fire-fighting robot. The robot uses infrared sensors to detect fires 🔥 and a water pump 💦 to extinguish them. Designed for slow, steady movement, it ensures thorough coverage and quick response to fire detections.

## 🌟 Features

- **Fire Detection**: Utilizes flame sensors to detect fires 🔥 from different directions.
- **Automatic Water Discharge**: Activates a water pump 💦 automatically to extinguish detected fires.
- **Controlled Navigation**: Moves forward slowly 🐢 to cover areas effectively.

## 🛠 Hardware Required

- Arduino Uno or similar Arduino board
- L293D Motor Driver Shield or compatible motor driver
- 2 x Flame sensors 
- 2 x DC motors for robot movement 🚗
- 1 x DC motor or water pump 💧 for extinguishing fires
- Battery for power supply 🔋
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## 💻 Software

The robot's behavior is controlled by an Arduino sketch that:
1. Reads inputs from the infrared sensors.
2. Controls the motors to move forward or stop based on sensor data.
3. Activates the water pump when fire is detected.

## 🛠 Setup and Deployment

Follow connections according to code.
